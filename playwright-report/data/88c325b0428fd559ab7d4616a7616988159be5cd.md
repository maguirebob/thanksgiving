          - paragraph [ref=e29]: I can’t remember if I had just finished college or was still at RIT, but I do remember the year Grandma Maguire couldn’t host Thanksgiving anymore. Hosting Thanksgiving ather apartment in Amesbury, Mass had become too much for her. I suggested to my Dad and Linda that they host it at their house and so I drove to Amesbury to pick her up so that she could help prepare the meal and spend time with us.
          - paragraph [ref=e30]: Thanksgiving was Grandma’s holiday. She loved it more than any other because it was about the family coming together and the joy of serving others. I can still picture her—this photo is from her 80s. She was born in 1906 and lived a long, full life until early 2005. She was my giving tree.
          - paragraph [ref=e31]: That first year, she and I sat down to plan the menu. We pulled recipes from her memory, from Gourmet magazine, and from my cookbooks. The dishes I remember most are the Cajun deboned turkey, her comforting turkey soup made from the carcass, and the orange-cranberry relish that my Aunt Emogene loved so much.
          - paragraph [ref=e32]: What started as that one dinner became a tradition. Year after year, it grew into the Thanksgiving feast that we still carry on today. Grandma Maguire would be so happy to see all of you and to know that the tradition continues.
