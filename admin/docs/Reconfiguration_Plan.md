# Thanksgiving Website Reconfiguration Plan

> **Note:** This plan is designed to align with the conventions and workflow described in `admin/docs/Thanksgiving Website Architecture.md`. Please refer to that document for detailed standards, design-first practices, and implementation requirements. Each phase should include documentation updates and design reviews before implementation.

## Railway Deployment Guide

### Steps to Deploy to Railway (Test)
1. **Sign in to Railway**
   - Go to https://railway.app and log in or sign up.
2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click “New Project” and choose “Deploy from GitHub” or “Blank Project.”
   - If using GitHub, connect your repo and select the `thanksgiving-ts` folder.
3. **Configure the Project**
   - Set the root directory to `thanksgiving-ts` if prompted.
   - Set the build command: `npm run build`

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   - Add your `DATABASE_URL` and any other required environment variables in the Railway dashboard under “Variables.”
5. **Deploy**
   - Click “Deploy” or push a commit to your main branch if using GitHub integration.
   - Railway will install dependencies, build, and start your app.
6. **Verify Deployment**
   - Once deployed, open the provided Railway URL.
   - Test basic functionality (home page, login, etc.).
   - Check logs for errors in the Railway dashboard.
7. **Troubleshooting**
